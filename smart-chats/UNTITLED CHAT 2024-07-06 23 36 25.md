Based on your notes, the note \"Algoritmo de Euclides\" likely describes the Euclidean Algorithm, a method for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.
Would you like me to explain how the Euclidean Algorithm works?

Based on your notes, the Euclidean Algorithm is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. 

Here's how it works:

1. **Input:** You start with two integers, let's call them 'a' and 'b'.
2. **Divide and find the remainder:** Divide the larger integer (a) by the smaller integer (b) and find the remainder. 
3. **Replace and repeat:** Replace the larger integer (a) with the smaller integer (b), and replace the smaller integer (b) with the remainder.
4. **Iterate:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the remainder is 0. 
5. **The GCD:** The last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original two integers.

**Example:**

Let's find the GCD of 24 and 18:

* 24 divided by 18 gives a remainder of 6.
* Replace 24 with 18 and 18 with 6.
* 18 divided by 6 gives a remainder of 0.

Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder, which is 6, is the GCD of 24 and 18.

**In short:** The Euclidean Algorithm repeatedly finds remainders until it reaches 0, at which point the previous remainder is the GCD.
